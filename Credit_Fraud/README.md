# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The objective is to build a model that identifies fraudulent activities with high accuracy.

## âœ¨ Features
- Data preprocessing to handle imbalanced datasets
- Applied Naive Bayes for fraud detection
- High accuracy and precision in identifying fraudulent transactions
- Visualizations for fraud trends

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SVarshiniBhat/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Projects/Credit_Fraud
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python credit.py

## ðŸ“Š Results
Achieved 95%+ accuracy, effectively identifying fraudulent transactions.
